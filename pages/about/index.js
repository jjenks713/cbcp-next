      I believe in making a living out of something you love doing. When I was given the ultimate question in school, “What do you want to be when you grow up?” – I had no clue. People kept saying that being an artist was a joke. I knew that I enjoyed drawing, I could sit all day and work on one piece of art. I was excited every time I saw myself improving. That was about the time I decided that I didn’t care what others thought. If I wanted to draw all day, design things, and create portraits, I would make that my career. I am still extremely excited when I see myself improve. I enjoy learning new mediums and techniques. I work very hard to keep producing art, improving with every step. Every day is a struggle, but each struggle leads to a new victory.
